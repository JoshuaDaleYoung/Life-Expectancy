#Life-Expectancy
I analyzed the World Health Organization dataset of 22 different variables related to life expectancy over 193 countries for 15 years. 
A 2020 goal of mine is to fast 10% of the year. For me this became a 72 hour fast once a month. 
This was spurred on by Peter Attaia's research on extending life expectancy. 

Naturally as I was looking for a project to show my data analytic capabilities this data set became gold. 
A first glance at the data shows a lot of null values.  I filled the nulls with binned averages from a correlating variable.  
This provided fun insights like seeing alcohol decrease after people received some schooling and then increase after a few more years of schooling. Also Diphtheria vaccines are readily available in areas where no Polio vaccines are, but if you have a few Polio vaccines you have hardly and Diphtheria vaccines.  
At the begging of finding the average of two variables I was using queries. I knew this was inefficient and eventually created better code half way through my cleaning process. 
BMI was a variable I trashed out in the final analysis. The numbers didn't make sense. A morbidly obese BMI is over 40. The data had a countries averaging over 80. 
I find it also worth mentioning that Alcohol does have a positive correlation to Life Expectancy, but not a strong correlation. 
During the process I also created a strong predictive model, but didn't find a great use case for it, so I did not add it to my presentation. 

Finally we have the analysis of looking at many different variables and then choosing those that correlated strongest with Life Expectancy for the final presentation. 
Thank you for your attention.
